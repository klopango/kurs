# Kurs
[![Bless](https://cdn.rawgit.com/LunaGao/BlessYourCodeTag/master/tags/jesus.svg)](http://lunagao.github.io/BlessYourCodeTag/) `1.0.2-beta` <br><br>
Kurs came from the word 'kurensi' from Bahasa Indonesia.

The purpose of this package is to scrap currency data, but since I didn't put many effort in it. It will only return a string, for now.

## Usage

### Params
* Amount
* From
* To

<br>

```js
// kurs.scrap(amount, from, to)

kurs.scrap(1, 'idr', usd)
```

The code above will return :
<br>
```
1 IDR > USD = ... USD

```
